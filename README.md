This repository is my firts attent to starts programming so the contains the code and resources for the module practical work and assessments. Its purpose is to provide a structured environment for learning, applying, and demonstrating core programming and software development skills using the tools available on university machines or even at home computer, this was a very difficult task for me. hopefully I pass satisfactory 
To run and develop the code in this repository, I need the following tools and software (all available on university machines)
Python 3.10+, Git 2.34+ for version control VS Code (with C/C++ and Python extensions),Python Packages
A terminal or Git Bash for executing Git commands

Reflective Commentary

During this coursework, I used AI tools such as ChatGPT to support my understanding of certain programming concepts and to help clarify tasks within the brief. I mainly asked it to explain function behaviour, suggest approaches to structuring modules, and review sections of my Read.me I did not rely on AI to write full solutions instead, I used it to check my reasoning and compare alternative implementations.

The generated output was generally helpful in identifying potential improvements or highlighting common mistakes, although some suggestions were either overly generic or not directly applicable to the provided codebase. This required me to critically evaluate the responses rather than accept them at face value, which strengthened my ability to analyse code independently.

By working through and extending the C and Python codebase, I learned to better identify issues related to clarity, modularity, and maintainability. Implementing and refactoring functions helped me understand how small design decisions can influence the overall structure and readability of a program.

In a professional context, I would trust AI tools as assistive companions rather than authoritative sources. They can save time, generate ideas, and reveal alternatives I might not have considered, but they still require careful review and verification. Ultimately, responsibility for the final code must remain with the developer, and this coursework reinforced the importance of critical judgement when using AI.
